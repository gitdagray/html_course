# "HTML Project for Beginners"

âœ… [Check out my YouTube Channel with all of my tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/DaveGrayTeachesCode).

This repository shares the starter code for the [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/T5PD8ofhiug). 

**Your Challenge:** Utilize the knowledge you have gained from the [HTML for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Zuz27SZ-6OlAwitnFUubtE93DO-l0vu) tutorial series to build a website for The Little Taco Shop. 

**Directions:**

- There are images of the 3 web pages you need to build in the examples folder. Use them as references for what you build.

- You should name your files: index.html, hours.html, and contact.html

- There is minimal CSS already available in css/styles.css. You need to link that file to your HTML files. 

- All images are provided in the img folder.

- If you need to find taco emojis, try [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/taco/). 

- A favicon is already included. You'll need to add it in the head section of each page.
